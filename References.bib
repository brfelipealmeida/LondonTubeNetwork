	abstract = {Complex networks are a powerful modeling tool, allowing the study of countless real-world systems. They have been used in very different domains such as computer science, biology, sociology, management, etc. Authors have been trying to characterize them using various measures such as degree distribution, transitivity or average distance. Their goal is to detect certain properties such as the small-world or scale-free properties. Previous works have shown some of these properties are present in many different systems, while others are characteristic of certain types of systems only. However, each one of these studies generally focuses on a very small number of topological measures and networks. In this work, we aim at using a more systematic approach. We first constitute a dataset of 152 publicly available networks, spanning over 7 different domains. We then process 14 different topological measures to characterize them in the most possible complete way. Finally, we apply standard data mining tools to analyze these data. A cluster analysis reveals it is possible to obtain two significantly distinct clusters of networks, corresponding roughly to a bisection of the domains modeled by the networks. On these data, the most discriminant measures are density, modularity, average degree and transitivity, and at a lesser extent, closeness and edgebetweenness centralities.},

	abstract = {As a strategic factor for a country to survive in the global competition, transportation systems have attracted extensive attention from different disciplines for a long time. Since the introduction of complex network theory in the last decade, however, studies on transport systems have witnessed dramatic progress. Most roads, streets, and rails are organized as a network pattern, while link flows, travel time, or geographical distance are regarded as weights. In this article, the authors will present the current state of topological research on transportation systems under a complex network framework, as well as the efforts and challenges that have been made in the last decade. First, different kinds of transportation systems should be generalized as networks in different ways, which will be explained in the first part of this paper. We follow this by summarizing network measures that describe topological characteristics of transportation networks. Then we discuss the empirical observations from the last decade on real transportation systems at a variety of spatial scales. This paper concludes with some important challenges and open research frontiers in this field.},

	abstract = {Over the past several years, a number of measures have been introduced to characterize the topology of complex networks. We perform a statistical analysis of real data sets, representing the topology of diﬀerent realworld networks. First, we show that some measures are either fully related to other topological measures or that they are signiﬁcantly limited in the range of their possible values. Second, we observe that subsets of measures are highly correlated, indicating redundancy among them. Our study thus suggests that the set of commonly used measures is too extensive to concisely characterize the topology of complex networks. It also provides an important basis for classiﬁcation and uniﬁcation of a deﬁnite set of measures that would serve in future topological studies of complex networks.},

Basic concepts of such models can be developed in a variety of ways, and these are illustrated. The paper then outlines a number of other theoretical developments, and is particularly concerned with the disaggregation of such models, with the incorporation of time variables, and with the relation of spatial interaction, to more general, models. Uses of spatial interaction models are outlined briefly and the final section of the paper draws a number of conclusions and presents a summary.},

	abstract = {In this paper the modelling of overdispersion in generalised Poisson and multinomial models of migration flows and rates is considered, and its importance within the wider question of substantive model specification is shown. It is argued that substantive specification and the modelling of overdispersion are closely interrelated. Simplified ways of estimating the form of overdispersion—moments methods and pseudo-likelihood—are considered wherever possible. Overdispersion is set within the broader context of correlation effects which relate to migration—correlation across different destinations, between spatially adjacent origins and destinations, and between different time periods. The data used to illustrate the modelling development are drawn from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Longitudinal Study, the decennial Census, and the National Health Service Central Register.},
